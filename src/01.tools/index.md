# Tools

## Introduction

The following tutorials will mainly focus on open-source software for numerous reasons. The software we are going to be using is free, faster, smaller and, in terms of creating content for Re-Volt, easier to use if you’re just starting.

## Blender - 3D Modeling
1. Install Blender from [**blender.org/download/**](https://www.blender.org/download/)
2. Download the plugin/add-on here: [**Download**](https://github.com/Re-Volt/re-volt-addon/archive/master.zip), [GitHub page](https://github.com/Re-Volt/re-volt-addon)

## GIMP - Texture Creation
We will use GIMP for creating textures for the track. If you tried to use GIMP before and didn’t like it: Don’t worry. You will see that it suits our needs perfectly. Everything you could want to do with it will be explained in a later step.

[Download GIMP](http://gimp.org)

## Audacity

This is an option. If you are planning to have some sounds in your track or a custom engine sound for your car, you might want to download this audio editor to get your sound files right.

[Download Audacity](http://audacityteam.org/)

## Re-Volt

The tutorials focuses on creating tracks for [RVGL](https://rvgl.re-volt.io). Get the game [here](http://re-volt.io/downloads/game).


That's it for now. You are pretty much covered. What you should have now:

+ Blender and the add-on
+ GIMP
+ Audacity (if you want to edit sounds)
+ A clean installation of Re-Volt
